## Solving Problems

Step by step for better ways to solving algorithm problems. 

- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code.

For better execution of problem solving, make sure to write out steps for solving the problems. Whether it be commented out code or whiteboarding. 
Write each step out for execution of the code. 

After getting the code to work, next step would be refactoring. Rewrite the code and slim it down and streamline. 

## Value The Importance of Your Time 

#### “As a man thinketh, so is he. As he continues to think, so he remains.” -James Allen

Being busy doesnt mean you're productive. It is actually the opposite. The best time management is not your time filled with work, but time focused on specific goal 
accomplishment. Finish your goal for the day and the rest is yours. Just because you have a whole day filled with activity doesnt mean its a good thing. 
Only include activities that bring you closer to your goal and leave out the rest. 

Value your time and others will also. 

## Think Like a Programmer

Employers priortize problem-solving skills before everything else. 
Having the ability to break down large, complex problems is one of the highest qualities required to obtaining a job. 

To understand a thing or problem, you have to be able to explain it in lamens terms. 

Do not try to solve the problem as a whole. Break it down to individual problems and then solve them one by one. 

Solving problems is a skill, to be great at it, you need to practice, practice and practice some more. 

## The 5 Whys

A Japanese industrialist and inventor, Sakichi Toyoda, explains the 5 whys techniques. Basically when there is a problem or an issue with anything, you ask why. 
When you get the answer to the first why, ask the second why. The second why should dig deeper to the first whys issue. Continue this process of asking a specific why
to the issue, until you get to the root of the problem. The steps to follow are: 
1. Assemble a Team.
2. Define the Problem.
3. Ask the First "Why".
4. Ask "Why" Four More Times.
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
