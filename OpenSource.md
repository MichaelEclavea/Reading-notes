[What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open Source Software?](https://clearcode.cc/blog/why-developers-contribute-open-source-software/)

Overall these articles are very nice reads and references for starting out as a contributor to open source projects. It is also nice to help people in earlier stages than me, or even if they are a senior level developer. I have something or may know something they do not. It is nice to give back in a sense of a helping hand.
