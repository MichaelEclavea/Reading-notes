# Day 1 notes: 

### HTML & CSS 

HTML structures webpages. 
Tags <> </> containers. 

Attributes are contained in a tag and always have a value after. 
Structure of HTML page: 
<HTML>
<head>
<body>
<header>
<main>
<footer>
<HTML>

id = " "; id's are attributes placed in tags only specifying one item. It cannot be used to label multiple items. 

class = " " Unlike tags, classess are attributes used to label multiple objects. 

Block elements (h1, p, ul, li) always start in a new line down.
inline elements (a, b, em, img) continue on the same line as their neighbor.

<divs> group elements into a container block.

<inframe> is like a box container for another website. example: google maps.

escapte characters are used to make special characters. example @

### HTML5 layout

These tags are for helping the layout and correct placement of elements. 

<nav> navigation block

<section> like a div but, this element is more for grouped related information

<hgroup> multiple readings being grouped together. like from an h1 going down in size. 

#### NOTE: Their are a lot more container elements other than <div> specific to their tasks,
