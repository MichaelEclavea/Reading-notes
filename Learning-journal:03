# What I Have Learned


    Today specifically we learned about functions(). I had learned functions prior to today but, I did not fully understand it. Even today the whole picture still eludes me. I feel one step closer in comprehending what is going on. 
        Of course linking this topic of javascript is a great transition from the past 4 days. I had learned about HTML's role as the structure  and information container of a website.  
              Also CSS being the styler of the HTML document. CSS is main role is to add style and positioning of the information housed in the HTML document.
              Finally, Javascript! How js's role to ad function to our website. In my eyes it brings the website to life. With so many tools in javascript, we have just scratched the surface. It is very intimidating to know that just the first day or two of real javascript and it is already a struggle. Slowly but surely, I am understanding more as the class goes on.
