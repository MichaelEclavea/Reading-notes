# Advanced Mongo/Mongoose

1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?

- Because of the benefits of its built in organized structure and easy data manipulation and management. 

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
create, read, update and delete. 
These are all the necessary actions needed to managing data. 

3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
MongoDB is object collection database vs Postgres, which is a traditional column and row database.

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Mongoose is the modeling library used for mongoDB and essentially creates the schema files. 

##  Vocabulary Terms

- database: is a repository of information managed by a database engine which ensures integrity of data and fast access to the data.

- data model: is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

- CRUD: create, read, update and delete.

- schema: is the organization or structure for a database. A schema is created through modelling and is used when talking about both relational databases and object oriented databases.

- sanitize: The process of checking data to ensure there are no inputs that might make the program vulnerable to attacks (such as a SQL injection attack). Prevents users from entering data directly into a database. 

- SQL:  is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

- Non SQL(NoSQL): originally referring to non SQL or non relational is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This data is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

- MongoDB:  is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.

- Mongoose:  is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. 

- record: is a data structure that groups together related items of data. Source(https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z4tf9j6/revision/6#:~:text=A%20record%20is%20a%20data,one%20type%20of%20data%20together.&text=Creating%20records%20will%20vary%20in,features%20of%20the%20record%20structure)

- document: Any written text, illustrations or video that describe a software or program to its users is called program or software document. Source(https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_program_documentation.htm#:~:text=Any%20written%20text%2C%20illustrations%20or,called%20program%20or%20software%20document.&text=In%20modular%20programming%20documentation%20becomes,are%20developed%20by%20different%20teams.)

- (ORM) Object Relation Mapping: in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages.
