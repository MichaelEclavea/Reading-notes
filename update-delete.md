### Client/server architecture


The client and server is just the http protocol. This consists of the request and response cycle. 

The form element defines how the data will be sent from the users ends. The two main attributes for the form which are, method and action. 


the action attribute will look like this <form action="https://example.com">

without the action attribute the form can still be used but the user will not be brought to any other location other than the page they are already on.

The METHOD attribute defines how the data is sent. This is either going to be a GET or POST method. 

If <form action="https.jfwjhwj.com" method="GET" > the GET is telling the browser to get this information with the .get.body 

<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>

The POST method, does not append the data to the URL. The POST is better to use if sending a large amount of data. 

Setting up a form basics: 

 <input id="animal">  The input (id) and the label (for) attribute link them together.    <label for="animal">
