3. Console.error() used to hold errors

Console.assert() test if a condition is met, console write to conosle only if consdition is false.

### Breakpoints 

#### Steps: 
1. From browser go to developer tools and go to sources
2. Find file breakpoints at left menu
3. click on spot to stop running at that location on code.

### Debugger

Type debugger anywhere on your code. If developer tools are open, it will automatically create a breakpoint.
