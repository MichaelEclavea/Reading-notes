# CSS LAYOUT READING NOTES

The major concept of web layout is everything is a box. Some elements are block elements that take up the whole width
of the page. Inline elements only are a block of the size of what that element contains. 

Their are different positioning names that position blocks. 
Relative, Absolute, fixed and float are different names. 

Relative positioning moves in relation to where it would have been in normal page flow. 
Absolue positioning takes the element out of the normal flow. it also does not effect the flow of other elements.
Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning but sticks to the screen page. 
Float left or right side of its container. The inline elements wrap around it depending on the left or right call.
