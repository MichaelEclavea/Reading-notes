### Ethics in the the Workplace
#### Project Dragonfly
I have read the article on project Dragonfly from Google, and I definitely do not agree with its stance on making a deal with China if oppression is what Google is getting paid to do. Obviously money is always an issue with any company and it is a real factor in keeping any company alive. But, I think even so Google is not physically capturing people and locking them up, they are doing it in a different, less pronounced way. I can be a company that sales knives for cooking. But if I know that the people I am about to do business with, sign contracts with, shake hands with, is going to use my knives for an intentional reason to hurt people, I would not design the knives that is tailored to help them. I would feel morally and ethically just as guilty as the people I sold the knives too.

#### Ethical dilemma of self driving cars

This article was very intriguing. It is the foundation of the difficult choice of self driving cars, what to do if their is no other option? If a child jumps in front of the car, does the car steer right and run over pedestrians? Does the car steer left and run into another car? Does it keep going straight and hit the kid? That is a very difficult question and in the end it will be us humans deciding the result and telling the car who to hurt. How do we as a civilized and high moral people choose which one is less than the other? Or a maybe more debatable question, despite age or gender, are we all the same? If it was a choice between a 5yr old kid and a 80yr old man, who do we choose? I cannot specifically answer this question and I wouldn't know where to start honestly. It will be the topic that must be answered soon, because as this article states, self driving cars are already here.
