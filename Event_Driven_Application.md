# Event Driven Application

1. Why is access control important?
- Because You only want assigned users the access to delete or change content on your site. 

2. Describe an application that would need   access control.
- Basically every app that has user login. 

3. What is a role used for?
- A role is used for assigning users the access to have certain abilities. This is important for distinguishing each users role and capabilities of access.

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
-  Because role based access control is set through parameters based on defined roles as users. This will automatically be given depending on the role of the user. This is a lot more scalable than mandatory or discretionary because these have to be checked for each user. Not great for a scalable or growing user base.
