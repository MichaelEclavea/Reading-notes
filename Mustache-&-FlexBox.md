# Mustache & FlexBox

### JavaScript Templating with Mustache
JavaScript templating is a fast rendering of templates on the clients end using JSON.

Mustache.render();
{{}} double mustaches are a placeholder.

Mustache -express can be installed in the terminal using npm.
    $npm install mustache --save

    We would then need to require it in our javascript to use mustache. 

    ### FlexBox

    This also helps to create a more adaptive website. 

    Available properties:
