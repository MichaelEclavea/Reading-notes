# NODE.JS (Node, Express & APIs): 

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

The V8 engine was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.
