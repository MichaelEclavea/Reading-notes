# EJS PARTIALS

EJS Partials are just reusable templates or code that is used across multiple pages. 
To implement this, we first create a partials directory inside our views directory. Next We create a nabar.ejs file which holds the nab bar for our html file. 

For whatever other partial you come up with, you will create another .ejs file within our partials directory.

Use <%- include(PARTIAL_FILE) %>

Example: 

<%- include('partials/navbar') %>
 

<%- include('partials/footer') %>


partials = directory
footer = file (footer.ejs)
