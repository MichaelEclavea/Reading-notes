# Stacks and Queues

This is another type of linked list. It contains a head, or in this case a Top and contains chained nodes. In order to get to any chained Node you must traverse thru to the top and then next node by node.
The method for removing a node is pop.
The method for adding a node is to push, but this means the new node is now the top.
A method to see if there is a top node to begin with, Peek is a method to view if there is a top. 
Lastly, isEmpty returns true or false depending if the stack is empty or not. 
A stack is a FIFO (First in first out type of linked list). A queue on the other hand can have a reference to the front of its lists. This (front) is the exact same as a stacks top. But unlike a stack, a queue also has reference to its rear.
