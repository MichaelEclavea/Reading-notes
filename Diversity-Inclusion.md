# Diversity and Inclusion
In 2014 70% of employees at the top tech companies were male. This was attributed in part to the gaming in the 1980's. Which back then, gaming was primarily done on computers and the games were geared toward men and boys. 

In education, males also had the leg up in technology or STEM courses. Enrolling in college some make students could skip introductory programming because they were already introduced to it prior. By the time women were given the chance, they would opt out because of being so far behind the curb. 

The Center for Talent Innovation found that US women are 45% more likely to leave careers in technology. 


## Why diversity matters to your tech company

A study in 2003 looking at 177 banks found that racial diversity was tied to better financial performance. 

A study done in 2011 with the top firms regarding diversity found that female management led to increase of $42 million in firm value.
