## FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

Function programming is a style of building the structure and elements of a computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-stat and mutable data - (Wikipedia).

Pure Functions = are functions that return the same result if given the same arguments. 


Higher-order functions = a function that returns a function as a result && takes one or more functions as arguments. 

Filter() - this built in function determines whether the callback expression is true, if so it will include the true to the result collection.

map() transforms a collection by applying its function to all of its elements returning a new set of values. 

Reduce() - recieves a function and a collection and returns a value created by combining them.


## Refactoring JavaScript

Hash functions are functions that can be used to map data of any size to fixed values. 
The return of value are hash values. 

Strategies for writing more readable code: 

Return early from functions.
Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences.
Check for web APIs before implementing your own functionality.
